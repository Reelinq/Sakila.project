This is my Sakila-project. Project is made for movie rental company called Sakila. The idea is to give people opportunity to rent movies using a webside. Movies are designed to be physical and customers supposed to claim them from certain shop because this Sakila-project task is made in 2006.



To use this website you need to have XAMPP installed. If you dont have it, you can download it there https://www.apachefriends.org/

After you installed XAMPP, download zip-file called "sakila database" from this website https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html
Unzip it for example to the "C:/temp folder (this path is usied in example).
Open XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL. Open "Shell" from the right side of the panel.

After that run index.js file an go on the website called localhost:3000. Everything should be working now.
